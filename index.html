            6. Now we have to specify the branch in which we want to push the code
            initially by typing "git branch -M main". Here "main" is the name of the
            branch and is created by github by default
          </p>

          <p>
            7. Now we have to add all our files for pushing to github by typing
            command "git add ." where "." indicates all the files. If you want to add individual files, you can write the name of the file instead.
            And after that u commit all the files before push otherwise it give an error as shown in figure.
