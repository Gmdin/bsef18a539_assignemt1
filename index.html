    <h1>Github Version Control System</h1>
    <p>This page will explain the basics of github's version control system</p>

    <p>
      1. Login to your github account and create a new repository by clicking
      the "New" button as indicated by the Yellow heading in the picture.

        as shown below and click on create repository.
      </p>

      <p>
        3. Now a set of instructions and path of your repository will be visible to you on the screen for setting up you project for github on Cmd . We will be going through all of them. The instructions page will look like as shown in the picture below
      </p>

      <p>
        4. Open the terminal in your project folder and type command "git init" to
        initialize the project for github and check the current status of repository.
      </p>

      <p>
        5. Then we have to give the local project the path of the github repo
        where we want to store our code. The is done by typing the command shown in the figure.
        </p>

        <p>
            6. Now we have to specify the branch in which we want to push the code
            initially by typing "git branch -M main". Here "main" is the name of the
            branch and is created by github by default
          </p>
          <img src="/img/branch.JPG" alt="">
          <p>
            7. Now we have to add all our files for pushing to github by typing
            command "git add ." where "." indicates all the files. If you want to add individual files, you can write the name of the file instead.
            And after that u commit all the files before push otherwise it give an error as shown in figure.
          </p>
          <img src="/img/add_commit.JPG" alt="">
          <p>
            8. Finally we can push our files to github by command "git push
            --set-upstream origin main" specifying the branch in which we want to push
            the code "main" in our case
          </p>
          <img src="/img/codePush.JPG" alt="">
          <p>
            9. Now if we head back to github again and refresh the page we can see
            the code we just pushed
          </p>
          <img src="/img/codePushed_inRepostry.JPG" alt="">
          <p>
              10. After changing or adding more code we can simply repeat the step no 7 an 8 and see changing in the repository as shown in figure.
          </p>

           <p>
            12. Finally, we can copy our project's url to anybody and they can the
            copy the project to their own system.
          </p>
